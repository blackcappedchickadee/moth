= Portlet test bench

This application is for testing live portlet features both in the browser (click click) and by xUnit tests.
The xUnit tests are called by html2jsr286[http://github.com/lamikae/html2jsr286] and django-marionet[http://github.com/youleaf/django-marionet].

Caterpillar includes this portlet into a vanilla Rails application:

  rails new_app
  cd new_app
  caterpillar pluginize

Add "map.caterpillar" to your config/routes.rb!

Now the command
  caterpillar portlets

Should output

 * Portlet configuration ***********************
